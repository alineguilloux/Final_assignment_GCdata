# Final_assignment_GCdata
this repo contains the code I used to submit the final assignment to Getting and Cleanig Data course.
At start you should open an R or RStudio session and set up a new R project.

Open the run_analysis.R file.

The first bit of code is used to download the files in the computer, and as tou may already have the files, I sugest skipping this part, as it takes a while, depending on the internet connection.

During my work I found some trouble with the inital dataset, and managed to solve it removing some double spaces between columns. 

I also prefered to name the variables on the dataset prior to selecting the columns, just because I used them to select the position of the columns with means and standard deviations. 

The final txt file has the data grouped by subject and activity, with the mean for every variable selected.
